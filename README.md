<p>This website is hosted on a local NGINX Server on my Home Server using Cloudflare Tunnels, hence why it has a custom domain. I own the domain "chrispanetta.com" and any illegal subdomains "*.chrispanetta.com" will take you to my personal website. The Spotify Playlist is the codes that I got off of the internet as made by the Spotify. The code is based on the iframe function while there are API Calls that are custom such as fullscreen and allowautoplay.</p>
<p>If you notice my commits, you will see that 2 accounts edited this page, chrispan-i3 and Chris4285. The first one is my work profile which was accidentally signed in to GitHub Desktop when I started the project. I noticed this error on this commit now and I apologize for that inconvenience.</p>
