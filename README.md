<p>This website is hosted on a local NGINX Server on my Home Server using Cloudflare Tunnels, hence why it has a custom domain. I own the domain "chrispanetta.com" and any illegal subdomains "*.chrispanetta.com" will take you to my personal website. The YouTube Video and Spotify Playlist are the two codes that I got off of the internet as made by the Spotify and YouTube Embed Generators. The code is based on the iframe function while there are API Calls that are custom such as fullscreen and allowautoplay.</p>
